RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation is a technique where a language model is fed with a document and allows you to query from the document. Currently, there are many different types of RAG methods for different use cases, from simple vector similarity retrieval to sophisticated Grap RAG methods or Agentic RAG, which offers transparency in the retrieving source.

For lightweight documents you can choose a simple vector-based RAG, for a complex document where the information comes from images, texts, and tables you can choose multi-modal RAG or for very large documents where similar context is far apart or big databases, Graph RAGs can be used.

This platform allows you to choose from different RAG methods and choose the best method for your use case. Moreover, you can go ahead to choose from different language models like llama, mixtral, phi, etc OR RAG frameworks like LangChain, llama-index, DsPy, etc OR embedding models, node parsers, vector databases.
